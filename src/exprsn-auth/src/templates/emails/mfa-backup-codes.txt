Your MFA Backup Codes

Hi {{displayName}},

You've successfully enabled two-factor authentication (MFA) on your {{appName}} account. Great job securing your account!

IMPORTANT: Save these backup codes in a safe place. You can use them to access your account if you lose access to your authenticator device.

YOUR BACKUP CODES:
{{#each backupCodes}}
{{this}}
{{/each}}

Each code can only be used once.

How to Use Backup Codes:
1. When prompted for your authenticator code, enter one of these backup codes instead
2. Each code can only be used once
3. Generate new codes from your security settings when you run low

Keep These Codes Secure:
- Store them in a password manager or encrypted file
- Print them and keep in a safe place
- Don't share them with anyone
- Don't store them in plain text on your device

Manage your security settings: {{securityUrl}}

You can generate new backup codes at any time from your security settings. When you generate new codes, the old ones will stop working.
